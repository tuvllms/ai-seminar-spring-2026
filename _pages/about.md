<b>Course description</b>

The primary goal of this course is to examine recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. We will study advances in LLM training, alignment, and evaluation, covering topics such as Transformers and novel architectures, LLM pretraining and post-training, efficient training and inference, large reasoning models and test-time scaling, multimodal models, diffusion models, agentic AI, self-evolving agents with reasoning memory, etc. Students will also learn how to read and evaluate research papers, formulate research problems, and develop potential solutions. The course is intended for graduate students who want to apply recent advances in LLMs and GenAI to their own research.
